# osmani

A project to have the first steps for NLP tasks on old Turkish language.

Almost nothing has done in that area.

This project is the baby step for a huge thing. It is for preparing some initial training data for machine learning algorithms.

See the project page : http://www.aliok.com.tr/projects/2014-10-25-osmani.html

For anyone interested, the data is in <https://github.com/aliok/osmani/tree/master/data/src/main/data/book-annotation>
